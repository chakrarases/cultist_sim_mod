DATA MODDING - ALPHA - UNSUPPORTED - USE AT OWN RISK - BACK UP EVERYTHING BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING

Edit the contents of /core folders to change existing content.
Add content to /more folders to create more content. Don't duplicate ids.

Updates will usually overwrite /core. Updates on some platforms might delete /more. Don't keep your source files in there.


Things you currently can't do that I might add later:

- set the priority of a recipe - this is determined by the alpha order in the folder (/core always precedes /more)
- add your own art
- add your own endings
- get remotely useful feedback on why the game has crashed because you left a curly bracket out.
- read any documentation, except that I believe #datamining on the community Discord has already created their own.

Dream furiously
